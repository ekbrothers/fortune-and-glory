## Overview

This project implements proven machine learning approaches for detecting archaeological sites using satellite imagery. Based on peer-reviewed research, it combines synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral data to identify archaeological features, particularly mounds and settlement remains.

### Core Objectives
- Automate detection of archaeological sites across large areas
- Combine multiple satellite data sources for improved accuracy
- Implement validated machine learning approaches
- Provide reproducible methods for archaeological prospection

### Key Features
- Multi-sensor data integration
- Temporal analysis capabilities
- Machine learning-based classification
- Probability mapping for site detection
